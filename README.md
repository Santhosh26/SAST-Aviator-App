## üî® Building from Source

### Development Setup

1. **Clone repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd SAST-Aviator-App
   ```

2. **Install development dependencies**:
   ```bash

```bash
python build_app.py
```

**Build Options**:
- **Flet Pack** (Recommended): Native Flet packaging
- **PyInstaller**: Custom spec with optimizations
- **Auto-fallback**: Tries Flet first, falls back to PyInstaller

**Build Output**:
- **Executable**: `dist/SAST_Aviator.exe` (Windows) or equivalent
- **Build Info**: `dist/README.txt` with build details
- **Single File**: Self-contained executable with dependencies

### Custom Build Configuration

Edit `build_app.py` to customize:
- Application name and version
- Icon file location
- Included/excluded dependencies
- Platform-specific options

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "FCLI not found" Error
**Solution**:
1. Download FCLI 3.5.1+ from Fortify
2. Add FCLI to your system PATH
3. Restart the application
4. Run "Check FCLI" in Step 1

#### "OpenSSL not found" Error
**Solution**:
1. Install OpenSSL for your platform
2. Ensure OpenSSL is in PATH
3. Test with `openssl version` in terminal
4. Restart the application

#### Application Won't Start
**Solutions**:
1. Check Python version (3.8+ required)
2. Verify all dependencies installed
3. Check logs in `logs/` directory
4. Run from command line to see error messages

#### Audit Fails to Execute
**Common Causes**:
1. SSC session expired - re-login in Step 5
2. Aviator session expired - re-login in Step 6
3. Invalid application mapping - verify in Steps 7-8
4. Network connectivity issues

#### Multiple Windows Opening (Packaged App)
**Solution**:
1. Close all instances via Task Manager
2. Run only the executable from `dist/` folder
3. Avoid running multiple build commands simultaneously

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging:
1. Check `logs/sast_aviator_YYYYMMDD.log`
2. Look for ERROR and WARNING messages
3. Report issues with relevant log excerpts

### Getting Help

1. **Check logs**: Review application logs for error details
2. **Verify prerequisites**: Ensure FCLI and OpenSSL are properly installed
3. **Test connectivity**: Verify network access to SSC and Aviator services
4. **Configuration review**: Check `config.ini` for correct settings
